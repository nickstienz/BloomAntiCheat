# Bloom Anti-Cheat

Bloom Anti-Cheat is a general purpose anti-cheat written in Luau and Rust for the Roblox Platform.
The anti-cheat uses Luau as it's primary language and Rust for static analysis.
A developer can drop the folders into place and use the public API in order
make it work with their game.

## Public Modules

Public Modules are the modules you can and should use in order to make better
use of Bloom. It should be noted that there are many modules under Bloom that can
be accessed, but shouldn't. They are used for internal operations between files.
For safety, you should only use the modules listed here as they are tested and safe
for external operations.
