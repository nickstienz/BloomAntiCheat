# Bloom Anti-Cheat

Bloom Anti-Cheat is a general purpose anti-cheat written in Luau and Rust for the Roblox Platform.
The anti-cheat uses Luau as it's primary language and Rust for static analysis.
Bloom has a focus on accuracy in order to make the anti-cheat fair to normal
players as they won't randomly be flagged for cheating.

So long as I maintain the project, it will remain free to anyone. If you can help with the
project, please contact me in any way. From here on is the technical details so 
have fun while you can!

## Plans

Plans goes over all the ideas I had and other stuff I worked on.

## Public Modules (Bloom API)

Public Modules are the modules you can and should use in order to make better
use of Bloom. It should be noted that there are many modules under Bloom that can
be accessed, but shouldn't. They are used for internal operations between files.
For safety, you should only use the modules listed here as they are tested and safe
for external operations.
